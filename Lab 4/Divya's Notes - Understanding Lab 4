"A (VERY) QUICK PRIMER ON .BASH_PROFILE FOR MAC USERS

There is a hidden file in your Macâ€™s user directory named .bash_profile. This file is loaded before Terminal loads your shell environment and contains all the startup configuration and preferences for your command line interface. Within it you can change your terminal prompt, change the colors of text, add aliases to functions you use all the time, and so much more."
