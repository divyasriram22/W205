    "Provide the answers to the following questions in a file called Lab1-answers.txt\n",
    "\n",
    "Q1: What is the difference between EBS and S3?\n",
    "    \n",
    "    EBS is Amazon's elastic block store, which eseentailly is a virual hard drive to use with EC2. It is not a storage \n",
    "    service that exists alone, without an EC2 like S3 is. S3 is Amazon's simple storage service that can store and \n",
    "    retrieve any amount of data from any EC2.\n",
    "\n",
    "Q2: When would you consider a cloud infrastructure for your data science tasks?\n",
    "    \n",
    "    A cloud infrastructure is best used when on a budget because it is a cheaper option. When your data science task \n",
    "    requires low IOPS and you can process your data elsewhere (not on the cloud infrastructure itself), and your main \n",
    "    intention is to store data, then this is the best way to go.\n",
    "\n",
    "Q3: What is the difference between spot instances and reserved instances?\n",
    "    \n",
    "    There appears to be no difference in performance between the two. The spot instance is cheaper than the spot \n",
    "    instance and is paid for by bidding on the spot (EC2 instance). However the spot can be sold to someone else when \n",
    "    it's value increases from your bid price. The reserved instance lets you pay by upfront to use a particular system \n",
    "    for a certain period of time.\n",
    "\n",
    "Q4: List the names of four software packages installed on the UCB AMI\n",
    "    \n",
    "    Python, Linux, Apache Storm, Hadoop"
