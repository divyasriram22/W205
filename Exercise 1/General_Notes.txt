Notes to myself (Feb 28th,2017):

1. Go back and fix scripts if I have time later. (They don't work right now)
2. Had a really hard time finding (and then understanding) background information about the data.
3. Struggled with subqueries and understanding logic for trying to run complicated queries.
4. Go back and understand how  e-x-a-c-t-l-y ER diagrams should be made.
