It's important to note here that we are evaluating high-quality care based on a variety of procedures.

“consistently high scores” implies the least amount of variance in scores

	SELECT AVG (var_score) FROM 
		(SELECT provider_id, variance(score) as var_score 
		FROM effective_care_table_t GROUP BY provider_id) a;

	Looks like the average variance in scores is about 5400



Variety of procedures: want hospitals that offer a greater number of procedures. The following query will determine the average number of procedures offered by these hospitals.

	SELECT avg(num_procedures) FROM 
		(SELECT provider_id, COUNT (*) as num_procedures 
		FROM effective_care_table_t GROUP BY provider_id);
		
	Average number of procedures offered by hospitals is 22



It is important that the best hospitals have a lower variance than that of the calculated average: 5400, and more procedures than the avg procedures for the hospitals: 22.  


	SELECT x.* FROM (SELECT hospital_name, sum(score) as agg_score,  variance(score) as var_score, avg(score) as avg_score,  
	COUNT (measure_id) as num_procedures FROM effective_care_table_t WHERE score IS NOT NULL GROUP BY hospital_name) x 
	WHERE x.num_procedures > 22 and x.var_score < 5400 ORDER BY x.avg_score DESC LIMIT 10; 


**Note, the average variance and scores are marked by hard coded values in this query because I was lazy and this was easy. These averages will have to be recalculated each time a new data set is presented or values are changed (cannot universally use the query as is).

The results for the hospitals with consistent, high quality care are the following: 

x.hospital_name			x.agg_score	x.var_score	x.avg_score	x.num_procedures
