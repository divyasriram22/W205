Are average scores for hospital quality or procedural variability correlated with patient survey responses?

This website here (http://www.hcahpsonline.org/files/HCAHPS%20Fact%20Sheet%20May%202012.pdf) describes the base_score in the surveys as
a total score, tallied from each of the 8 individual aspects of the survey that evaluated the hospitals.

	
The following query joins the two tables effective_care and survey_reponses and groups the hospitals by their base and consistency scores from the surveys and the general score from the effective_care table and the results are ordered from highest general score to the lowest. We view the top 25 to seea slightly larger snapshot of what's happening.

	SELECT hospital_name, score, x.base_score as base_score, x.consistency_score as cons_score
	FROM survey_responses_table_t x
	INNER JOIN effective_care_table_t y
	ON y.provider_id = x.provider_id
	WHERE x.consistency_score IS NOT NULL and x.base_score IS NOT NULL and y.score IS NOT NULL 
	GROUP BY x.hospital_name, y.provider_id, x.consistency_score, x.base_score, y.score
	ORDER BY y.score DESC
	LIMIT 25;

Let's take a look at how the base_scores are distributed. The median value for base_scores is: 15
	
	SELECT percentile(cast(base_score as BIGINT), 0.5) FROM survey_responses_table_t;

The median value for base_scores is 15. A cursory glance at the first query we ran, we would expect that base_score values of 15 and higher (the top 50%) would be associated with the higher general scores for the hospitals, but that was not necessarily the case. In fact, majority of the base_scores for the top general score hospitals were in the bottom half of the base_score values. From this particular query, it seems that average scores for hospital quality or procedural variability are not necessarily correlated with patient survey responses.



Note: In previous investigations (like the query from best hospitals- show below), I was able to include the average scores based on number of procedures and variance, but I did not know how to incorporate these two factors into my query above so I used avg score as is. This is not correct, I am aware. 

	SELECT x.* FROM (SELECT hospital_name, sum(score) as agg_score,  variance(score) as var_score, avg(score) as avg_score,
        COUNT (measure_id) as num_procedures FROM effective_care_table_t WHERE score IS NOT NULL GROUP BY hospital_name) x
        WHERE x.num_procedures > 22 and x.var_score < 5400 ORDER BY x.avg_score DESC LIMIT 10;
